# Learn Chef Rally - Learning Notes

## 0. Intro

This repository is learning notes I write while learning about Chef from [Learn Chef Rally](https://learn.chef.io/). This note is mainly created so that I can learn the materials as if I'm about to teach them to someone else, just as suggested in [The Feynman Technique](https://collegeinfogeek.com/feynman-technique/). If you find this note is useful, most credits go to the folks at Learn Chef Rally.
